# Mario mlx

This project was made to learn how to use mlx and create animations for a simple game, the goal was to recreate the first map of the original mario game. 
It was made using MLX (A simple ```X-Window X11R6 programming API in C```, designed for students of 42 school).

## How to use

```bash
make run
```
- This will compile and run the game using the map provided inside the folder ```./maps/1-1.ber```

## Map
The map is composed of characters that represent each element of the map, them beeing:
-  M: Represent where the player will spawn, this also is the reference for the second player;
-  Z: Brick blocks;
-  1: Main floor;
-  
-  K and I:  K is the bottom part of the tubes and I is the top part;
