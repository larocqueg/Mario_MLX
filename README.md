# Mario mlx

This project was made to learn how to use mlx and create animations for a simple game, the goal was to recreate the first map of the original mario game. 
It was made using MLX (A simple ```X-Window X11R6 programming API in C```, designed for 42 school students).

## How to use

```bash
make run
```
- This will compile and run the game using the map provided inside the folder ```./maps/1-1.ber```
